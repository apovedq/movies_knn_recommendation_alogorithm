# Final Exercise (Socio-Technological Interaction)
## Goal
Develop a recommendation system using a python backend and javascript frontend which represents the friction between selected actor profiles and correlate them with certain movies.

### Dependencies
#### Python-Libraries
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Sklearn
    - Flask
    - CORS

#### Javascript
    Nothing really, just start a server at front-end/sti-js/

### Building
Follow the instructions at server/README.md, or execute server/run.sh (`bash server/run.sh`)

As for the JS server, live-server will do, but you can also use `python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1`
